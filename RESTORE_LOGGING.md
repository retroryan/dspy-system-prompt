# Proposal: Restore Detailed Demo Logging

## What Was Lost in Simplification

The previous conversation history demo had rich, detailed logging that showed:

1. **Turn-by-turn breakdown**: Clear separators showing query progression
2. **Context awareness**: Display of previous interaction counts
3. **Execution metrics**: Timing, iterations, tools used
4. **Memory management**: Active trajectories, summaries created
5. **Final summary**: Complete conversation overview
6. **Progressive stats**: How conversation state grows

## Current vs Previous Demo Structure

[Complete conversation history with context flow]

✅ Demo Complete!
Key Observations:
1. The agent maintained context across 6 queries
2. Later queries built on information from earlier ones
3. Memory management worked efficiently
```

### Current Demo (Minimal Logging)
```
Step 1/6: What's the current weather in Des Moines, Iowa?

🌾 Result: Currently in Des Moines...

📊 Execution: 2.3s, 2 iterations
💾 Memory: 1 conversations in context

Step 2/6: Based on that weather, should I plant corn today?  
💭 This query builds on previous conversation context

🌾 Result: Based on the weather data...

📊 Execution: 1.8s, 1 iterations
💾 Memory: 2 conversations in context
```

## Proposed Enhancement: Rich Demo Logging

### Design Principles
1. **Non-verbose mode**: Not debug logging, but demo-specific rich output
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Show how conversation state builds
3. **Visual clarity**: Clear separators and sections
4. **Educational value**: Demonstrate agent architecture concepts
5. **Timing insights**: Show execution patterns

### Implementation Approach

#### 1. Enhanced Demo Logger Class
```python
class DemoLogger:
    """Rich logging for demo workflows without verbose mode complexity."""
    
    def __init__(self, demo_name: str, total_queries: int):
        self.demo_name = demo_name
        self.total_queries = total_queries
        self.query_number = 0
        self.start_time = time.time()
        
    def log_query_start(self, query: str, context_count: int):
        """Log the start of a query with context information."""
        self.query_number += 1
        print(f"\n{'='*80}")
        print(f"Turn {self.query_number}/{self.total_queries}")
        print(f"{'='*80}")
        print(f"🗨️  Query: {query}")
        print(f"📚 Context: {context_count} previous interactions")
        if context_count > 0:
            print("💭 This query can build on previous conversation context")
        print()
    
    def log_execution_start(self):
        """Log React loop start."""
        print("🤖 React Agent Processing...")
        self.iteration_start = time.time()
    
    def log_execution_complete(self, result):
        """Log React loop completion with metrics."""
        execution_time = time.time() - self.iteration_start
        print(f"✓ React loop completed in {execution_time:.1f}s")
        print(f"  Iterations: {result.iterations}")
        if result.tools_used:
            print(f"  Tools used: {', '.join(result.tools_used)}")
        else:
            print("  Tools used: None (used context)")
    
    def log_extract_phase(self):
        """Log extract phase."""
        print(f"\n📝 Extract Agent")
        print("✓ Answer extracted and synthesized")
    
    def log_result(self, answer: str):
        """Log the final answer."""
        print(f"\n🎯 Result:")
        # Wrap for readability
        import textwrap
        wrapped = textwrap.fill(answer, width=70, 
                               initial_indent="   ",
                               subsequent_indent="   ")
        print(wrapped)
    
    def log_conversation_stats(self, session):
        """Log conversation state and memory."""
        print(f"\n📊 Conversation Stats:")
        print(f"  - Total interactions: {session.history.total_trajectories_processed}")
        print(f"  - Active trajectories: {len(session.history.trajectories)}")
        print(f"  - Memory summaries: {len(session.history.summaries)}")
        
        # Show memory management in action
        if len(session.history.summaries) > 0:
            print(f"  - Memory window: Active (summaries created)")
        else:
            print(f"  - Memory window: All conversations retained")
    
    def log_demo_complete(self, session):
        """Log demo completion with full summary."""
        total_time = time.time() - self.start_time
        
        print(f"\n{'='*80}")
        print("📋 Final Demo Summary")
        print(f"{'='*80}")
        
        print(f"\n🎯 {self.demo_name} Workflow Complete!")
        print(f"⏱️  Total execution time: {total_time:.1f}s")
        print(f"🗨️  Queries processed: {self.query_number}")
        print(f"🧠 Memory state: {len(session.history.trajectories)} active, {len(session.history.summaries)} summarized")
        
        print(f"\n✅ Key Demonstrations:")
        print(f"  ✓ Context building across multiple queries")
        print(f"  ✓ Memory management and conversation continuity") 
        print(f"  ✓ Tool usage with context awareness")
        print(f"  ✓ Natural workflow progression")
        
        # Show conversation flow if requested
        if len(session.history.trajectories) > 1:
            print(f"\n📜 Conversation Flow:")
            for i, traj in enumerate(session.history.trajectories, 1):
                print(f"  {i}. {traj.user_query[:60]}...")
```

#### 2. Updated Demo Structure
```python
def main():
    """Run the complete agriculture demo workflow with rich logging."""
    
    # Setup
    setup_llm()
    session = AgentSession("agriculture", user_id="demo_farmer")
    queries = get_farming_workflow()
    
    # Initialize rich demo logger
    demo_logger = DemoLogger("Agriculture", len(queries))
    
    # Demo header (simplified)
    print("╔" + "═" * 58 + "╗")
    print("║" + " " * 8 + "Agriculture Demo: Complete Workflow" + " " * 8 + "║")
    print("╚" + "═" * 58 + "╝")
    
    # Process each query with rich logging
    for i, query in enumerate(queries):
        # Log query start with context info
        context_count = len(session.history.trajectories)
        demo_logger.log_query_start(query, context_count)
        
        # Log execution start
        demo_logger.log_execution_start()
        
        # Execute query
        result = session.query(query)
        
        # Log execution complete
        demo_logger.log_execution_complete(result)
        
        # Log extract phase
        demo_logger.log_extract_phase()
        
        # Log result
        demo_logger.log_result(result.answer)
        
        # Log conversation stats
        demo_logger.log_conversation_stats(session)
        
        # Brief pause for readability
        time.sleep(0.5)
    
    # Final demo summary
    demo_logger.log_demo_complete(session)
```

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Educational**: Shows agent architecture concepts clearly
2. **Progressive**: Demonstrates conversation state building
3. **Non-intrusive**: Not verbose mode, just rich demo output
4. **Consistent**: Same logging across agriculture and e-commerce demos
5. **Insightful**: Shows timing patterns, context usage, memory management

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create DemoLogger class** in `shared/demo_utils.py`
2. **Update agriculture_demo.py** to use rich logging
3. **Update ecommerce_demo.py** to use rich logging  
4. **Keep simple structure** but add detailed progress tracking
5. **Maintain performance** with minimal overhead
