# Demo 3 Fixed - All Demos Working ‚úÖ

## Issue Resolution

Demo 3 (Property Search) was failing because:
1. It tried to use `AgentSession` with a non-existent tool set name
2. The AgentSession expects predefined tool sets, not dynamically created ones

## Solution Implemented

Rewrote demo 3 to:
- Use direct tool execution through the registry (like demo 2)
- Implement intelligent tool selection based on query content
- Format responses appropriately for each tool type
- Handle optional parameters correctly (excluding None values)

## All Demos Now Working

### ‚úÖ Demo 1: Tool Discovery
Shows dynamic discovery of 6 tools from MCP server

### ‚úÖ Demo 2: Direct Tool Execution  
Executes property search, Wikipedia search, and health check

### ‚úÖ Demo 3: Property Search (Fixed)
- Property searches with price filters
- Neighborhood research via Wikipedia
- Luxury property searches
- Intelligent tool selection based on query

### ‚úÖ Demo 4: Complete Showcase
Runs all demos in sequence successfully

### ‚úÖ Demo 5: Integration Tests
All 5 tests passing (100% success rate)

### ‚úÖ Demo 6: Quick Test
Fast connection validation showing 6 discovered tools

## Running the Demos

```bash
# Interactive menu with all options
./run_mcp_demo.sh

# Run specific demo
./run_mcp_demo.sh 3    # Now works perfectly!

# Run all demos (note: --all waits for Enter between demos)
./run_mcp_demo.sh 4    # Complete showcase without pauses

# Quick test
./run_mcp_demo.sh --quick
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Fixed optional parameter handling** - None values are excluded from arguments
2. **Intelligent tool selection** - Chooses appropriate tool based on query content
3. **Proper response formatting** - Different formatting for properties vs Wikipedia
4. **Error handling** - Graceful handling of tool execution failures
5. **No dependency on AgentSession** - Works directly with registry
