# LLM Shortcomings and Model Compatibility Issues

## Overview
This document tracks issues encountered with different LLM models when using DSPy's agent framework, particularly focusing on structured output generation and tool selection capabilities.

## Critical Issue: Empty/Invalid Responses from Certain Models

### Issue Description
Some LLM models fail to generate valid structured JSON responses when prompted by DSPy's Predict/ChainOfThought modules, resulting in empty responses or None values. This causes the agent to immediately default to "finish" without executing any tools.

### Affected Models
- **openrouter/openai/gpt-oss-120b**: Consistently returns empty responses for complex structured output requests

### Working Models
- **anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514**: Properly generates structured JSON responses and executes tools correctly
- **anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet**: Expected to work based on architecture
- **openai/gpt-4o**: Expected to work based on architecture
- **openai/gpt-4o-mini**: Needs testing

## Reproduction Steps

### 1. Using Existing Test Infrastructure

The project already includes a comprehensive evaluation harness in `llm_eval/`. Use these existing tools to test model compatibility:

```bash
# Test current model configured in .env
poetry run python llm_eval/test_current_model.py

# Test a specific model
poetry run python llm_eval/test_single_model.py openrouter "openai/gpt-oss-120b" "GPT-OSS-120B"

# Run full evaluation across all models
poetry run python llm_eval/run_full_eval.py

# Quick evaluation with subset of models
poetry run python llm_eval/run_quick_eval.py
```

The evaluation harness automatically tests:
- Tool selection accuracy
- Multi-step reasoning capability
- Structured output generation
- Error recovery
- Iteration efficiency

### 2. Full Agent Test
Run the complete agent loop with different models:

```bash
# Test with different models
export LLM_MODEL=openrouter/openai/gpt-oss-120b
./run_demo.sh ecommerce 4

export LLM_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514  
./run_demo.sh ecommerce 4

# Check for warnings about tool mismatches
```

### 3. Debug Mode Analysis
Enable debug mode to capture the actual LLM responses:

```bash
export DSPY_DEBUG=true
export DEMO_VERBOSE=true
./run_demo.sh ecommerce 4 2>&1 | tee model_test_output.log

# Analyze the prompt history files
ls -la prompts_out/ecommerce_react_*.json
```

## Key Indicators of Model Issues

1. **Empty Assistant Responses**: In the prompt history JSON files, look for:
   ```json
   {
     "role": "assistant",
     "content": ""
   }
   ```

2. **Immediate Finish**: Agent completes in 1 iteration without using any tools:
   ```
   ‚úì React loop completed in 0.08s
     Iterations: 1
     Tools used: None
   ```

3. **Tool Mismatch Warnings**:
   ```
   ‚ö† Tools mismatch - Expected: search_products, Got: 
   ```

## Detailed Test Results (December 13, 2025)

### E-commerce Test Cases Performance

We tested models on 5 challenging e-commerce test cases that require multi-step reasoning and tool selection:

#### Test Case 4: Product Search with Price Filter
**Query:** "Search for wireless headphones under $100"
**Expected Tools:** search_products

| Model | Result | Tools Used | Notes |

#### Test Case 14: Comparative Shopping with Price Optimization
**Query:** "Compare gaming keyboards under $150 and wireless headphones under $100. Add the highest-rated item from each category to my cart, but only if the total stays under $200."
**Expected Tools:** search_products, add_to_cart, get_cart

| Model | Result | Tools Used | Notes |
|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| gpt-oss-120b | ‚ùå FAIL | None | Empty response |

#### Test Case 15: Order Tracking and Conditional Return
**Query:** "For user demo_user, check the status of their most recent order. If it's been delivered and contains any electronics over $500, initiate a return for the most expensive item citing 'changed mind'."
**Expected Tools:** list_orders, track_order, get_order, return_item

| Model | Result | Tools Used | Notes |
|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| gpt-oss-120b | ‚ùå FAIL | None | Empty response |

| gpt-4o | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | list_orders, get_order, return_item | More efficient path, skipped track_order |

#### Test Case 18: Multi-product Shopping with Budget
**Query:** "I need to buy a laptop under $1000 and gaming accessories under $200. Add them to my cart and calculate the total."
**Expected Tools:** search_products, add_to_cart, get_cart

| Model | Result | Tools Used | Notes |
|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| gpt-oss-120b | ‚ùå FAIL | None | Empty response |
| claude-sonnet-4 | ‚úÖ PASS | search_products, add_to_cart, get_cart | Correct execution |
| gpt-4o-mini | ‚úÖ PASS | search_products, add_to_cart, get_cart | Correct execution |
| gpt-4o | ‚úÖ PASS | search_products, add_to_cart, get_cart | Correct execution |

#### Test Case 19: Abandoned Cart Recovery
**Query:** "Check what's currently in my cart. If the total is over $500 and includes any out-of-stock items, remove them and suggest similar alternatives that are in stock."
**Expected Tools:** get_cart, remove_from_cart, search_products, add_to_cart

| Model | Result | Tools Used | Notes |
|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| gpt-oss-120b | ‚ùå FAIL | None | Empty response |
| claude-sonnet-4 | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | get_cart | Cart was empty, correctly stopped |
| gpt-4o-mini | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | get_cart | Cart was empty, correctly stopped |
| gpt-4o | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | get_cart | Cart was empty, correctly stopped |

### Key Findings

1. **Model Failure Pattern**: gpt-oss-120b consistently returns empty responses when asked to generate structured JSON output for tool selection. This appears to be a fundamental incompatibility with DSPy's structured output format.

2. **Tool Selection Efficiency**: All working models (Claude, GPT-4o variants) often find more efficient paths than the expected tool sequence, particularly skipping redundant verification steps. This is actually good behavior showing intelligent optimization.

3. **Best Performers**: 
   - **GPT-4o-mini** showed excellent performance, even passing the complex test case 14 that other models struggled with
   - **Claude Sonnet 4** showed consistent high-quality reasoning but sometimes skipped verification steps
   - **GPT-4o** performed well but showed similar patterns to Claude in skipping some verification steps

4. **Context-Aware Stopping**: For test case 19, all working models correctly identified that the cart was empty and stopped processing rather than continuing with unnecessary operations. This shows good contextual understanding.

## Workaround Implemented

In `agentic_loop/react_agent.py`, we added fallback logic to handle empty responses:

```python
# If we didn't get a valid tool selection, try to infer from the query
if not tool_name or (tool_name == "finish" and not thought_content):
    # For simple product searches, default to search_products
    if "search" in input_args.get("user_query", "").lower() and "search_products" in self.all_tools:
        self.logger.debug("No valid tool selected, inferring search_products from query")
        thought_content = "I need to search for products based on the user's query."
        tool_name = "search_products"
        # Extract search parameters from the query
        # ... parameter extraction logic ...
```

## Recommendations for Future Testing

1. **Create a Model Test Suite**: Before deploying with a new model, run the structured output test script above.

2. **Capture Metrics**: For each model, track:
   - Response time
   - Token usage
   - Success rate for structured outputs
   - Tool selection accuracy
   - Cost per query

3. **Test Different Prompt Formats**: Some models may work better with different prompt structures:
   - JSON schema in system prompt
   - Few-shot examples
   - Different instruction formats

4. **Monitor DSPy Compatibility**: Keep track of DSPy version updates and their model compatibility notes.

## Testing Checklist for New Models

- [ ] Run `test_model_structured_output.py`
- [ ] Execute all ecommerce test cases (1-20)
- [ ] Check for tool mismatch warnings
- [ ] Verify prompt history files contain valid responses
- [ ] Test with both simple and complex queries
- [ ] Measure response times and token usage
- [ ] Document any special configuration needed

## Running Comprehensive Model Tests

To identify which models have issues like gpt-oss-120b:

```bash
# 1. First, remove any workarounds/fallbacks in the code
# Edit agentic_loop/react_agent.py to remove inference logic

# 2. Test a specific problematic model
export LLM_MODEL=openrouter/openai/gpt-oss-120b
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-key-here

# 3. Run with debug output to capture the issue
export DSPY_DEBUG=true
export DEMO_VERBOSE=true
./run_demo.sh ecommerce 4 2>&1 | tee model_test_gpt-oss.log

# 4. Check the prompt history for empty responses
cat prompts_out/ecommerce_react_*.json | jq '.entries[0].conversation[] | select(.role=="assistant") | .content'

# 5. Run the full evaluation suite
poetry run python llm_eval/test_single_model.py openrouter "openai/gpt-oss-120b" "GPT-OSS-120B"

# 6. Compare with a known working model
export LLM_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
./run_demo.sh ecommerce 4 2>&1 | tee model_test_claude.log
```

### Analyzing Test Results

Look for these specific failure patterns:

1. **Empty LLM Responses**:
   ```json
   {"role": "assistant", "content": ""}
   ```

2. **Immediate Task Completion**:
   ```
   Iterations: 1
   Tools used: None
   Tool: finish
   ```

3. **High Iteration Count** (hitting max without completing):
   ```
   Reached maximum iterations (10)
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. **Automated Model Testing Pipeline**: Create a CI/CD pipeline that tests all models periodically.

2. **Model-Specific Adapters**: Implement model-specific prompt formatting to maximize compatibility.

3. **Fallback Chain**: Implement automatic fallback to a known-good model when primary model fails.

4. **Response Validation**: Add stricter validation of LLM responses before processing.

5. **Model Capability Detection**: Automatically detect and document each model's capabilities:
   - JSON mode support
   - Function calling support
   - Structured output support
   - Maximum context length
   - Response consistency
