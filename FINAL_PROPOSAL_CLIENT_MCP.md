## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive architecture for integrating MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools into the existing project without any dependency on DSPy. The solution leverages the key insight from DSPy's architecture: **tools should be instances, not classes**. By treating tools as instances that wrap callable functions, we eliminate all complexity around dynamic class generation and create a clean, maintainable system that supports both static class-based tools and dynamic MCP-discovered tools.

## Core Architecture Insight

After analyzing DSPy's implementation, the fundamental breakthrough is understanding that tools don't need to be classes. DSPy treats tools as instances of a single `Tool` class that wraps any callable function. This callable can be:
- A regular Python function
- An async function  
- A lambda function
- A closure that captures external state (like an MCP session)

This approach eliminates the need for:
- Dynamic class generation
- Complex metaclass programming
- Runtime type creation
- Inheritance hierarchies for each tool

## The Problem We're Solving

The current architecture assumes all tools are classes that inherit from `BaseTool`. This works well for static tools defined at compile time, but creates significant complexity when trying to integrate MCP tools that are discovered dynamically at runtime from a server. Previous attempts have tried to dynamically generate classes for each MCP tool, leading to complex and fragile code.

## Proposed Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Lightweight Tool Wrapper Class

A simple tool wrapper class that can encapsulate any callable function. This design is inspired by DSPy's Tool class but implemented without any DSPy dependency. The wrapper provides a uniform interface for executing functions, whether they are synchronous or asynchronous, and handles argument validation through Pydantic schemas. The key innovation is that tools become instances that wrap functions rather than classes that must be inherited.

#### 2. Modified BaseTool to Support Instances

The BaseTool class is enhanced to support both traditional class-based tools (existing behavior) and new instance-based tools. This dual-mode support allows the same interface to work with statically defined tool classes and dynamically discovered tool instances. The enhancement maintains complete backward compatibility while enabling the flexibility needed for MCP integration.

#### 3. MCP Tool Proxy

The MCP tool proxy is a single, reusable class that can represent any MCP tool discovered from a server. The critical innovation is the use of closures to capture the MCP client session. When a proxy is created for a specific tool, it creates an inner function that captures both the tool information and the MCP client reference. This closure-based approach eliminates the need for global state management, dependency injection frameworks, or complex lifecycle management. Each tool proxy instance maintains its own connection reference through the closure, making the system both simple and reliable.

#### 4. MCP Client Wrapper

A thin wrapper around the FastMCP client library that provides a clean interface for tool discovery and execution. The client handles HTTP transport to communicate with MCP servers, manages connection lifecycle, and provides methods for discovering available tools and executing them. The wrapper abstracts the complexity of the MCP protocol while providing a simple, Pydantic-based interface that integrates seamlessly with the rest of the system.

#### 5. Dynamic MCP Tool Set

A specialized tool set implementation that discovers its tools dynamically at runtime from an MCP server. Unlike traditional tool sets that define their tools as static classes, this tool set connects to an MCP server during initialization, discovers available tools, and creates proxy instances for each one. The tool set overrides key methods to indicate it provides instances rather than classes, allowing the registry to handle it appropriately. This design enables seamless integration of remote MCP tools into the existing tool infrastructure.

#### 6. Enhanced Tool Registry

The tool registry is enhanced to intelligently handle both traditional class-based tool sets and new instance-based tool sets. When registering a tool set, the registry checks whether it provides classes or instances and handles each appropriately. For class-based tools, it instantiates them as before. For instance-based tools, it uses the provided instances directly. This dual-mode support is completely transparent to code using the registry - tools are accessed the same way regardless of how they were registered.

## Implementation Flow

### Tool Discovery and Registration

1. **MCP Server Running**: An MCP server exposes tools via the MCP protocol
2. **Client Connection**: MCPClient connects to the server
3. **Tool Discovery**: Client queries server for available tools
4. **Proxy Creation**: For each tool, create an MCPToolProxy instance
5. **Closure Capture**: Each proxy captures the client in its execution closure
6. **Registration**: Proxies are registered in the ToolRegistry as instances
7. **Ready to Use**: Tools are available for agent execution

### Tool Execution Flow

1. **Agent Selects Tool**: Agent decides to use tool "search_properties"
2. **Registry Lookup**: Registry finds the MCPToolProxy instance
3. **Validation**: Proxy validates arguments against schema
4. **Closure Execution**: Proxy executes its closure function
5. **MCP Call**: Closure calls `client.call_tool()` with captured client
6. **Server Execution**: MCP server executes actual tool logic
7. **Result Return**: Result flows back through proxy to agent

## Key Design Patterns

### Closure-Based Session Management

The most critical pattern borrowed from DSPy is using closures to capture the MCP client. When creating a tool proxy, an inner function is defined that captures both the MCP client and tool information from its enclosing scope. This function becomes the tool's execution method. The closure maintains its own reference to these resources without requiring global state, dependency injection frameworks, complex lifecycle management, or session pooling. This elegant approach ensures each tool instance is self-contained and thread-safe.

### Instance vs Class Flexibility

The architecture supports both static class-based tools (traditional approach) and dynamic instance-based tools (for MCP and other runtime discoveries). Static tools are defined as classes that inherit from BaseTool, while dynamic tools are instances created at runtime. Both types work identically from the registry's perspective, providing a unified interface for tool execution regardless of how the tool was defined or discovered.

### Async-to-Sync Bridge

The architecture elegantly bridges the gap between MCP's asynchronous protocol and our synchronous-only architecture. When executing an MCP tool, the proxy detects if the result is a coroutine and automatically runs it in a synchronous context using asyncio.run(). This transparent conversion allows async MCP tools to work seamlessly in our sync-only system without requiring any changes to the calling code.

## Example Usage

### Setting Up MCP Tools

To use MCP tools, you create an MCP tool set with the server URL, register it with the tool registry, and the tools become immediately available. The tool set connects to the server, discovers available tools, creates proxies for each, and registers them with the system. From that point forward, the tools are indistinguishable from static tools.

### Using MCP Tools in Agent

Agents use MCP tools exactly like static tools. When an agent session is created with MCP tools registered, it can call them through the standard tool execution interface. The agent doesn't need to know whether a tool is statically defined or dynamically discovered - the execution is completely transparent.

## Error Handling Strategy

### Connection Failures
- Graceful degradation when server unavailable
- Clear error messages to user
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Fallback to cached tool list if available

### Discovery Failures
- Partial discovery supported
- Individual tool failures don't break system
- Clear logging of issues
- System continues with available tools

### Execution Failures
- Detailed error messages from server
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Clear feedback to agent
- No state corruption

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Support for API keys in headers
- OAuth2 token support
- Certificate-based authentication
- Secure credential storage

### Authorization
- Tool-level access control
- User context passing
- Rate limiting support
- Audit logging

### Data Protection
- TLS for all communications
- No sensitive data in logs
- Secure argument validation
- Input sanitization

## Performance Optimization

### Connection Pooling

The MCP client can optimize performance by maintaining a pool of connections that are reused across tool executions. Instead of creating a new connection for each tool call, the client can check for available connections in the pool and reuse them, significantly reducing latency.

### Caching

Tool discovery results can be cached to avoid repeated server queries. The tool set can store discovered tools with a time-to-live (TTL) value and only re-query the server when the cache expires. This reduces server load and improves response times for tool initialization.

### Lazy Loading

Tools can be instantiated only when first accessed rather than all at once during discovery. The registry can store tool metadata and create the actual proxy instances on demand, reducing memory usage and startup time for systems with many tools.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each component in isolation
- Mock MCP server responses
- Validate argument validation
- Test error handling
- Verify closure behavior

### Integration Tests
- Test with real MCP server
- End-to-end tool discovery
- Complex argument scenarios
- Error recovery testing
- Performance benchmarks

### System Tests
- Full agent sessions with MCP tools
- Multi-tool workflows
- Load testing
- Failover scenarios
- Security testing

## Migration Path

This architecture is purely additive - no breaking changes:

1. **Existing Tools Continue Working**: All current class-based tools work unchanged
2. **Gradual Adoption**: MCP tool sets can be added alongside existing ones
3. **No Code Changes Required**: Agent code doesn't change
4. **Backward Compatible**: All APIs remain the same
5. **Opt-in Enhancement**: Use MCP tools only where needed

## Conclusion

This proposal provides a clean, maintainable solution for integrating MCP tools without DSPy dependency. By adopting the key insight that tools should be instances rather than classes, we eliminate all complexity around dynamic class generation. The use of closures for session management, borrowed from DSPy's design, provides elegant state management without globals or complex dependency injection.

The architecture follows all principles in CLAUDE.md:
- No dynamic class generation
- No hasattr or isinstance usage
- Clean Pydantic models throughout
- No union types
- No wrapper functions
- Direct, simple implementations
- No compatibility layers
- Complete cut-over design

This design provides a solid foundation for dynamic tool discovery while maintaining the simplicity and reliability of the existing system. The implementation can proceed in phases, with each phase providing value and being independently testable.
